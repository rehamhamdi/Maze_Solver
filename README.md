# Maze Solver
# Abstract
The maze solver system is a Java application designed to visualize and solve mazes
using various algorithms.The system provides a graphical user interface (GUI)
where users can interactively create, modify, and solve mazes of different
sizes and complexities.
It offers implementations of three maze-solving algorithms: Depth-First
search (DFS), Breadth-First Search (BFS), and A* Search.
Users can open pre-definec maze files , draw their own mazes ,
select the start, and end points, and apply algorithms
to find the shortest path between them.
The system renders the maze grid and algorithm progress in
real-time, providing a dynamic and intuitive experience for
users to understand and explore maze-solving techniques
