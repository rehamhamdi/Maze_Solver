# Maze Solver
# Abstract
The maze solver system is a Java application designed to visualize and solve mazes
using various algorithms.The system provides a graphical user interface (GUI)
where users can interactively create, modify, and solve mazes of different
sizes and complexities.
# Features 
Users can open pre-definec maze files , draw their own mazes ,
select the start, and end points, and apply algorithms
to find the shortest path between them.
The system renders the maze grid and algorithm progress in
real-time, providing a dynamic and intuitive experience for
users to understand and explore maze-solving techniques.

# Algorithms
 It offers implementations of three maze-solving algorithms:
•	Breadth First Search

•	Depth First Search

•	A* star Search

# Keys
•	Left Click -> Wall

•	Rigth Click -> End (Target Node)

•	Middle Click -> Start
